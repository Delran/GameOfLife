Implementation of Conway's Game of life using Python PyQt and Matplotlib.

Features :

    GUI:
        The Game of life can be paused and resumed at any time

    Scene loader/saver :
        Any scene can be loaded in the Game's grid at chosen coordinates.
        Scenes can be rotated by 90Â° clockwise and counter clockwise
        Scenes can be flipped horizontally and vertically

        Added scene will override any cell with a different state.

        Game of life Patterns can be read and stored as scenes, supported format are :
            Plain Text : .cells
            Run length Encoded : .rle
        Anything filename that is not terminated with a supported extension will be ignored

How to use :
      You can start and pause the game at any time with the dedicated buttons
      Any file with the .rle or .cells extension located in the subfolder "Scenes"
  will be loaded into the combobox at the top left of the screen

      You can choose anyone of them and click the "Add scene" button,
  you can also specify a set of coordinates where the scene will be added.

      You can select any added scene with the given list, and move them with the ZQSD or arrow keys
      F2 to rename the scene and Suppr to delete it, you can also right click on them to show a context menu
      You can use the keys A and E to rotate it counter clockwise and clockwise respectively
      You can use the keys W and C to flip it horizontally and vertically respectively

      Scene are loaded from top to bottom, you can reorder them with drag and drop
      ( Scenes only override living cell so this feature is not that useful )

      You must press the Merge scene button to add your scenes to the game, once merged
      a scene cannot be interacted with anymore and will be removed from the scene list

      If you start the game without merging the scene, they will disappear while the game is running and
      reappear the next time you press the pause button.

Limitations :

    Edit Mode:
        The use of matplotlib FuncAnimation makes that the view doesn't update in real time
        this result in a few ms of lag between input from user and refresh on the game

Future :

    Edit mode
    Integration of .life format
