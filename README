This is a ( for now ) console based implementation of the Game Of Life written in Python

Features :

    Scene loader/saver :
        The current scene can be saved in a easily editable CSV file.
        Any scene can be loaded in the Game's grid at chosen coordinates.
        Added scene will override any cell with a different state.
        Simple patterns such as a glider and a pulsar are stored as scene
        WARNING : A scene MUST BE a rectangle


Future :

    Working on a curses implementation for console graphics
