Console based implementation of Conway's Game of life using Python and Curses.

Features :

    Scene loader/saver :
        Any scene can be loaded in the Game's grid at chosen coordinates.
        Scenes can be rotated by 90Â° clockwise and counter clockwise
        Scenes can be flipped horizontally and vertically

        Added scene will override any cell with a different state.

        Game of life Patterns can be read and stored as scenes, supported format are :
            Plain Text : .cells
            Run length Encoded : .rle
        Anything filename that is not terminated with a supported extension will be ignored

Limitations :

    Scenes/Patterns:
      Currently, the only way to add a scene/pattern is by adding lines to main.py

    Display :
      The game's greed cannot realistically be higher than around 50 cells high.
      Console graphics cannot produce a cell smaller than an ascii char.

Future :

    Edit mode
    Integration of .life format 
    PyQt Integration
