        Game of life Patterns can be read and stored as scenes, supported format are :

------------------------------------- HOW TO USE ---------------------------------------------
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GAME'S GUI  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      You can start the game and pause it with the Start button.

      You can add and edit any number of scenes directly loaded from the Scenes folder ( see below )

      The Fush button will discard everything on the game's grid, it will not touch the scenes that
  were not yet added to the grid.
      The Save button saves the current state of the game's grid to a file with the given name, an
  additional checkbox ask for also saving the loaded grids.
      The randomize button WILL DISCARD the grid's state and randomize the cells on the grid, it will
  not touch the loaded scenes.

      The game's grid is resizable in the right panel of the screen
      WARNING : RESIZING THE GRID WILL DISCARD EVERYTHING, ANY LOADED SCENE WILL BE FLUSHED FROM THE
  LOADED SCENE LIST.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SCENES LOADING & EDITING --------------------------------------------------------------------

      FOR ANY OF THIS TO WORK, YOU HAVE TO SELECT A SCENE IN THE LOADED SCENE LIST,
      SHORTCUTS AND MOUSE INPUTS WILL NOT BE TAKEN IN ACCOUNT IF THE FOCUS IS NOT
      ON THE LOADED SCENES LIST

      SCENES ARE INDEPENDANTS AND ARE NOT ADDED TO THE GAME'S GRID UNTIL YOU PRESS
      THE "MERGE SCENES" BUTTON, THERE ARE NOT LOST IF YOU LAUNCH THE GAME BEFORE
      MERGING

      You can select any added scene with the given list, and move them with the ZQSD kes, arrow keys or by
  clicking or dragging directly on the Game of life
      F2 to rename the scene and Suppr to delete it, you can also right click on them to show a context menu
      You can use the keys A and E to rotate it counter clockwise and clockwise respectively
      W and C to flip it horizontally and vertically respectively
      Ctrl+D to duplicate

      Most of those shortcuts can also be acceded by right clicking any of the scenes in the loaded scene menu

      You can right click on the Game's grid and select one of two option :
          - Add scene here : this will create the selected scene at mouse position
          - Duplicate here : this will duplicate the selected scene at mouse position ( keep orientation )

      Scene are loaded from top to bottom, you can reorder them with drag and drop
      ( Scenes only override living cell so this feature is not that useful )

      You must press the Merge scene button to add your scenes to the game, once merged
      a scene cannot be interacted with anymore and will be removed from the scene list

      If you start the game without merging the scenes, they will disappear while the game is running and
      reappear the next time you press the pause button.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PAINT MODE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Paint scenes are scene that do not behave like any other scene,
      You can add one by clicking the Add paint scene button below the add scene button

      Paint scenes cannot be moved with the mouse but can be moved with ZQSD or by right clicking on them

      You can use the Right button to paint and the middle mouse to erase

Limitations :

    Edit Mode:
        The use of matplotlib FuncAnimation makes that the view doesn't update in real time
        this result in a few ms of lag between input from user and refresh on the game

Future :

    Integration of .life format
