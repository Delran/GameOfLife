Console based implementation of Conway's Game of life using Python and Curses.

Features :

    Scene loader/saver :
        Any scene can be loaded in the Game's grid at chosen coordinates.
        Added scene will override any cell with a different state.
        Simple patterns such as a glider and a pulsar can b stored as scenes.
        WARNING : A scene MUST BE a rectangle

Limitations :

    The game's greed cannot realistically be higher than around 50 cells high.
    Console graphics cannot produce a cell smaller than an ascii char.

Future :

    Edit mode
    Integration of standard Game Of Life pattern files
    Integration on a different graphics framework
